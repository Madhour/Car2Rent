---

Rent: rent_id, car_id, duration, free_kilometers, customer_id, employee_id, is_returned, date_rented, date_returned, employee_id_returned, mileage_returned
- A customer can only rent one car. mileage_returned is at first null and upon return updated. Every car that is rented must be issued by an employee.

---

Payment: rent_id, payment_amount, payment_date
- Every rent has a payment. If a certain km amount was exceeded, then the customer has to pay additional fees upon return
---

Addresses: address_id, street, house_number, city, country, zipcode
- Customers, Employees and Branches refer to addresses. This is useful because it ensures that every address follows the same format/structure

## Frontend

![Frontend](https://github.com/Madhour/CarRent/blob/main/Application/client/static/Frontend.PNG?raw=true)

The Frontend uses Flask to provide the routing and functionality of the application. Therefore the user gets directed to the action Fields: Insert; Edit/Delete and Read.
Using the predefined SQL Querys the User can See all Entries in table Cars for example to See the whole fleet. In addition to that the entries can be filtered. Through a creation form the user can add a new Car if the Company buys a new car. The Employee can change an entry if a customer rents a car.
